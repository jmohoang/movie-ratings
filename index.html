			<div>
				<p>This project explores the relationship between movies' IMDB Scores and the Number of users that vote for those IMDB Scores. You can learn more about the background of this project <a id="aboutToBackground" class="text-info" href=""><b>here</b></a>.</p>

				<h6>Structure</h6>
				<p>This visualization follows an Interactive Slideshow narrative hybrid structure. Interactive Slideshows combine the author-led structure and the user-led structure. The author-led structure starts with the welcome page that only has a button to the about page. From the about page, the structure leads to the overview of the data and then the conclusion.</p>
				<p>To help the user navigate the author-led structure, each of the scenes in the structure has the next and back button. These buttons help the user go forward or backwards in the visualization.</p>
				<p>The user-led structure offers the user the ability to deviate from the author-led structure if they wish to learn explore further. I use links to help users explore further. In the about page, there is a link to the background page where there is more information about the project. In the overview page, there is a link to the trend page and the to the summary page. These two pages show more graphs that help visually explore and understand the relationship between IMDB Scores and the number of users that vote.</p>
				<p>It could also be argued that the use of tooltips in the Scatter plot (in the overview page) and in the Line graph (in the trend page) are part of the user-led structure because they allow the user to explore more information in addition to what the author has chosen to display.</p>

				<h6>Scenes</h6>
				<p>Throughout the visualization, the pages are on a plain background with text being either black or gray. Other than in the graphs, links and buttons are have color. This follows Tufte’s minimalistic design principles. It also helps the user focus on important items to navigate the visualization.</p>
				<p>To show the overview of the data, I used a scatter plot. This was the best choice because it both the IMDB Scores and the number of voted users are independent of each other. Also, the scatter plot allows the user to explore each of the movies. The line graph was best to show the common trend between IMDB Score and the number of user votes because it is easiest to understand, though IMDB Score are categorical values. The summary plot is a bar graph that shows a typical number of user votes per IMDB Category. I rounded up the IMDB Scores to the nearest whole number to achieve the IMDB Categories.</p>
				<p>All the graphs have linear axes that range from 0. The axes are linear because the graphs are interested in distances between the IMDB Scores. Other scales would be very confusing when it comes to comparison between data values.</p>
				<p>An issue I had with my plots was number of voted users because it ranged from extremely low number to very high ones. To solve this, I divided the number of voted user by 1000 in the scatter plot and line graph. This way, hug numbers could not take up all the space in my graphs.</p>

				<h6>Annotations</h6>
				<p>For all my graphs, I have a heading and labeled axes. These labels help users understand the graphs even without reading through the text about the graphs. For the scatter plot and the line graph, I have tooltips that pop-up when the user focuses on a point. The tooltips look the same in both the graphs and they are cleared when the user moves the mouse away. In the bar plot, I have the average user votes on top of each bar. This helps the user understand better since there is really no visual difference between the IMDB Categories 0 and 10.</p>

				<h6>Parameters and Triggers</h6>
				<p>The important parameters in the visualization are the buttons and links because they trigger the change in scenes. All the buttons and links have the same blue color to help communicate to the user where they can trigger changes in the visualization. When hovered on, the buttons change color to help communicate their purpose to the user.</p>
				<p>Though the visuals of the buttons are built in Bootstrap, the functionality is built in D3 js. When buttons are clicked, the triggered event changes the display of the current scene to “none” and then the next desired scene’s display to “block”. This is also the same with the link in the about page and the links to the line graph and bard graph. This implementation was used because it was easiest. Even though all my graphs have the same dimensions, it would be still be much harder to change the nitty-gritty details between scenes. The downside is that I have repeated the code to recreate my graphs in multiple places.</p>

				<h6>Research Question</h6>
				<p>What is the effect of the number of movie voters on movies’ IMDB (Internet Movie Database) scores?</p>
				<p>The research question is based on the assumption that people rate their experiences when they really feel strongly about them. As such, I expect to see more people vote for movies that have either low or high IMDB scores, but not so much for IMDB scores in the middle.</p>
				<h6>Data</h6>
				<p>The data used in this project was obtained from <a class="text-info" target="_blank" href="https://data.world/popculture/imdb-5000-movie-dataset">data.world</a>. The dataset contains over 5,000 movies, each with 28 variables. The variables I was concerned with are <small class="font-weight-bold font-italic text-muted">imdb_score</small> and <small class="font-weight-bold font-italic text-muted">num_voted_users</small>.</p>
				<h6>Tableau</h6>
				<p>This visualization is based on D3.js. A version of this project was made in Tableau, and can be found <a class="text-info" target="_blank" href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/john.mohoang#!/vizhome/dashboard_403/Dashboard">here</a>.</p>

				<p>The scatterlplot above gives an overview of the smovie dataset. For each of the movies, the plot shows its IMDB Score and number of people that have voted for the movie. With the help of tooltips, it is easier to explore which movie is which.</p>
				<p>Due to the sheer number of movies in the data set, a lot of the points lie on top of each other. This makes exploration of the data a little difficult, however, the concentration of the data in cenrtiain areas shows the relationship between the IMDB Scores and the number fo users that vote. </p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<div class="divider mb-3"></div>
			<div>
				<p>Based on the plots/graphs in this visualization, the number of people that vote for movies generally increases with the IMDB score. As such, it is apparent that people don’t just vote for movies when they feel strongly about them, but they vote for movies when they really like them.</p>
